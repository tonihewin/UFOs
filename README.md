# UFOs

## Overview

  The purpose of this analysis is to provide a more in-depth view of UFO sightings by allowing the use of filters for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition, filtering will be done by date, City, State, Country and shape for 2010.


## Results

- More UFO sightings were found on the West Coast than East based on some of our findings:

## Summary

  In conclusion, we found that more often sighting of UFO's are found in the West Coast primarily based on the filtering data used. One recommendation that I would make would be to use additional sources /findings to compare. The 2nd recommendation that I would make is to use smaller data sources. The larger sets of data can become overwhelming, and not as easy to narrow down.
